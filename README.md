# Image-Splitter  
I have used python to create a image splitting program.  
This program takes a long image as input and splits it into one of three choices: 1. In A4 size standard 2. A custom size 3. Into multiple pieces as the user wishes.  
I hope this program will be helpful.  
I have also used pyinstaller to create an executable file so it can also be used.
